Once you’ve identified the manual processes in Stage 1, you can start looking at automation. The best tool for build and release automation is [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

<!--endintro-->

In GitHub Actions you have complete flexibility in managing your CI/CD processes including, building, deployment, testing, vulnerability analysis, linting and more. Find out more about [how to use GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) or jump into [the marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?category=&query=&type=actions&verification=) to find open-source actions that do all sorts of things.
