Many people have things they feel good at, and they usually perform well in those areas. Conversley, people often get stuck thinking that they are bad at a specific thing and this holds them back from reaching peak performance. Some examples include thinking you are bad at:

* Maths
* English 
* Public Speaking
* Documentation
* Software architecture
* Frontend or Backend

While you might be bad at those things right now, you can almost always improve to some degree, and usually by a fairly large margin. It's true that there might be limits to how much you can improve, but getting stuck in the mindset of **thinking you can't improve** is not very helpful. In the end, those thoughts will lead to a feedback loop where you never will improve.
